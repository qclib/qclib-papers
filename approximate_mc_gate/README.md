## First Steps

### 1. Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Before installing dependencies, it's a best practice to create a virtual environment to isolate the project's libraries.
Run the following commands in the terminal:


```bash
# Install virtualenv (if not already installed)
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
````
### 2. Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated (if used), you can now install the dependencies from requirements.txt. 
Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs all the listed libraries with their specified versions.

### 3. Starting the Jupyter Notebook

Now that all dependencies are installed, you can start the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open your default web browser in the Jupyter environment, where you can navigate to your notebook and open it.

Remember to keep your virtual environment activated whenever you are working on the project. When you're done, you can 
deactivate the virtual environment with the command:

```bash
deactivate
```
